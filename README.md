## This project relies heaviliy on the following open source projects:
  * https://github.com/YosysHQ/picorv32 - as the procesor we build off of
  * https://github.com/drichmond/RISC-V-On-PYNQ - for interfacing the PicoRV32 from PYNQ
  * https://github.com/byuccl/PYNQ-PRIO - as a working partial reconfiguration example in PYNQ
  
This block design for this implementation is in /designs/build/axi/

The partial block deisgns for partial bitstreams is in /designs/build/axi/partial

The project can be built with /designs/build/axi/makefile

To install the project (https://github.com/drichmond/RISC-V-On-PYNQ) call "sudo pip3 install ." in the top level directory
